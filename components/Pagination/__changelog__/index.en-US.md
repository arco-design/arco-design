2021-11-05

### 🐛 BugFix

- fix: When the `Pagination` component is under control of both `pageSize` and `current`, the calculation result of `pageSize` will overwrite `props.current`, causing the control of `current` to fail([#119](https://github.com/arco-design/arco-design/pull/119))

## 2.14.2

2021-04-23

### 🐛 Bugfix

- Fix the bug that the `pageSize` and `current` are changed at the same time when the `Pagination` component is in the controlled mode. The value of `current` is incorrect.

## 2.10.1

2021-03-05

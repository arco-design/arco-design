- The `treeSelect.tsx` under the `TreeSelect` component folder has been renamed to `tree-select.tsx`. Please note that it is referenced by the file path. In addition, we do not recommend to use it directly through the file path.If you pass the path, Because we cannot guarantee that the file name in the component will never change, try to only use the `index.tsx` entry file.

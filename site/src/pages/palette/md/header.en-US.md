## Introduction

The component library has a built-in color algorithm based on dynamic gradient, and based on the bright color algorithm, after inversion and fine-tuning, a set of color algorithm in dark mode is obtained.

The color palette contains 13 common colors, and each color is divided into 10 gradients. Usually, we take color-6 as the main color in the color palette.

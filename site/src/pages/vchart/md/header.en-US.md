## Introduction

VChart is a charting component library in VisActor visualization system. It wraps the charting logic based on visual grammar library [VGrammar](https://github.com/VisActor/VGrammar) and the component encapsulation based on visual rendering engine [VRender](https://github.com/VisActor/VRender). The core capabilities are as follows:

1. **Cross-platform**: Automatically adapt to desktop, H5, and multiple small program environments
2. **Storytelling**: Comprehensive annotation, animation, flow control, narrative templates, and other enhanced features for visual storytelling
3. **Scenes**: Deliver visual storytelling capabilities to end-users, unlock developer productivity


## Works with ArcoDesign themes

In order to provide a better experience for VChart in the Arco page environment, VisActor has launched an additional theme package called @visactor/vchart-arco-theme. This package has the following features:

Ready to use out of the box: With simple configuration, VChart styles can be automatically integrated into the ArcoDesign language and also automatically adapted to theme packages customized by users based on Arco.
Responsive: @visactor/vchart-arco-theme supports listening for changes of light/dark mode and CSS variable update on the page, and automatically updates the theme of the charts on the page.

The following is a partial demonstration of capabilities based on the Arco theme. A more complete demo can be viewed at [vchart](https://visactor.io/vchart/guide/tutorial_docs/Theme/Arco_Design)

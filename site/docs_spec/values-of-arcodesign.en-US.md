# Design Values

Arco Design is based on the design values of clear, consistent, rhythmic and open, trying to establish a pragmatic and romantic working style.

## Clear

> **Clear direction improves efficiency**

The improvement of efficiency is the basis of pragmatism. In the design, reduce the uncertain factors and the number of user judgments, clarify the information level orientation, to make the purpose of user operations clearer.

The clear design system makes intuitive product operation and one-step process; the clear information transmission and clear expression enable users to quickly understand and make judgments in a very short time.

## Consistent

> **Consistent design creates brand trust**

Brand consistency is the goal of pragmatism. The highly consistent style specification, operation process and presentation, as a unified design standard, reflects the sense of brand and trust of the product.

Consistent design standard makes the brand sense systematically expressed. A high-standard and consistent design system brings users a sense of brand trust and can also reduce the cost of repeated learning for users through consistent repetition.

## Rhythmic

> **The beating rhythm builds the beauty of Bytedance**

The rhythm of design is the romance of Bytedancer. The rhythm in the use of the product reflects user habits. The rhythmic design makes users operate naturally, reducing the burden of understanding and memorizing.

The design system has the same beauty of rhythm as music composition. The consideration of the layout of each information module, and the potential pursuit and grasp of the law of repetition and contrast between elements, constitute the beauty of rhythm in UI design. The pleasant rhythm allows users to easily complete tasks according to their habits.

## Open

> **Openness and inclusiveness serve as the way of problem solving**

Only an inclusive and open system can solve problems romantically. It is difficult to cover the complex business scenarios of middle and back-end products with a fixed design system, except an open and inclusive system.

There are many scenarios in the middle and back-end products. In order to solve actual specific problems and truly empower to business, the design system needs to be able to be flexibly adjusted within a configurable range and evolve appropriate design models and interactive forms, based on functions and scenarios.
